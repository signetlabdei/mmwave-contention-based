## ns-3 mmWave contention based model #

This repository contains the code to reproduce the results of the paper "*Performance Evaluation of Contention-based Channel Access for mmWave Sidelink Communications*", Brighenti et al., IEEE CAMAD 2022.

The code is based on [ns3-mmwave v4.0](https://github.com/nyuwireless-unipd/ns3-mmwave/releases) and [millicar v1.0](https://github.com/signetlabdei/millicar).
